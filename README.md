The Student Management System is a C program designed to manage student  information efficiently. It allows the user to perform various operations such as  adding new students, displaying all students, searching for a student by ID,  updating student details, calculating the average GPA, and finding the student  with the highest GPA


I’ve been diving deep into data structures and memory management recently, and I’m excited to have completed a super interesting project at Edges For Training Center with guidance from my instructor Mohamed Tarek. This project focused on building a Student Data Management System using C, and it pushed my coding skills to the next level! 💡

✨ Key Features of the Project:

📥 Add, delete, and modify student records seamlessly with a smooth UI powered by Linked Lists for dynamic data handling.

🎯 Get highest GPA with a click! The system can retrieve the top-performing student instantly.

⚙️ Dynamic memory allocation to optimize performance and make the system flexible for handling various datasets.


What I liked about this project was getting hands-on with:

Linked Lists to manage data flexibly and efficiently.

Dynamic Memory Allocation to ensure memory is used smartly, especially when handling student data.

Practicing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing student records in real-time.


The project not only enhanced my understanding of C programming but also reinforced my knowledge of how to structure data for maximum efficiency and performance. 📊

I’m so thankful to my instructor Mohamed Tarek for his valuable insights and guidance throughout the journey, and I’m excited to explore more in the world of software development! 🌍
